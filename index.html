        <h1>We're throwing a Backyard Wedding Bash!</h1>
        <p><strong>After 9 short years together, we finally did it! As in, we eloped on February 4th (yes, on a Tuesday morning at 830am) using the Express Marriage Ceremony offered by the LA County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk office at the LAX Courthouse. Romantic, we know.</strong></p> 
        <p><strong>So now it's time to party in our backyard! We'll start in the afternoon (say 3pm) on Saturday May 24th and plan to party all night.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>There will be food and booze and music. Specifics to come for those of you who love a detailed plan!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We appreciate you all so much for being part of our lives. Looking forward to more great memories together!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>There will be no ceremony, no seated dinner, no registry, no speeches (just kidding, Ray will obviously be giving one speech), and no formal attire.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Our crib is at 618 Woodlawn Ave, Venice. Please text us to RSVP./strong></p>
